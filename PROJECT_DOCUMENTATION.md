# Backup and Recovery System - Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a comprehensive backup and recovery system implemented in C++ that demonstrates advanced file system operations, compression, encryption, and backup strategies. The system supports incremental backups, data compression, encryption, automated scheduling, and integrity verification.

## Learning Objectives Achieved

### 1. File Systems

- **Path operations**: Cross-platform path handling and manipulation
- **File I/O**: Efficient reading and writing of large files

### 2. Backup Strategies
- **Full backups**: Complete backup of all files in a directory tree
- **Incremental backups**: Only backup files that have changed since the last backup
- **Change detection**: SHA-256 checksums and timestamp comparison
- **Backup chains**: Managing relationships between full and incremental backups

### 3. Compression
- **ZLIB compression**: Industry-standard compression for reducing backup size
- **Configurable compression levels**: Balance between speed and compression ratio
- **Stream compression**: Efficient processing of large files without loading entirely into memory
- **Compression statistics**: Tracking compression ratios and space savings

### 4. Data Integrity
- **SHA-256 checksums**: Cryptographic verification of file integrity
- **Backup verification**: Ensuring backups are complete and uncorrupted
- **Metadata validation**: Verifying backup information consistency
- **Error detection**: Identifying and reporting data corruption
